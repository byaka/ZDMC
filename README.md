## ZDMC 17.6 floating fps display-mode fixed

This is modified version of ZDMC, originally created by zidoo and based on Kodi 17.6 Krypton.

In this version i fixed problem, when ZDMC dont know about floating fps display-modes (23.976, 59.94) for 1080p and 2160P. So now this video modes works correctly also with AFR.
